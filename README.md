The main goal of this site was to create a website for a client who is running an independent fitness program/business, and needs to be able to easily book new clients and interact with them. This website is an extention of the previous assignment with changes made.

Primary change made to site by adding a responsive card content block in replacement of the previous list, as well as I have made the navigation bar responsive as well.
